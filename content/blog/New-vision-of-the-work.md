As IT people, a lot of us like their job, and if you read this article, it's probably because you're on a quest of knowledge, in a world which is changing every hour, and with a capcity of acceptation of changes. Furthermore, you are generally looking for efficiency. But why efficiency? Effficiency is a new vision of the work. Still in a lot of companies, you are in a best-efforts obligation system, which mean that you need to go to your office from 09:00am to 18:00pm. Fundamentaly, if you don do anything during this 9 hours, in a lot of companies, especially in Middle East, nobody cares. You did your 9 hours, خلاص , you did your day. On the other side, you have this result vision, which is just to have some results. As a CTO and a team leader, I never impose working hours to my employee. If you produce better work from home, between 20:00 and 05:00, it's ok for me, if you deliver what you've promised. This vision is linked to the fact that job are having a greater intellectual value, as a result of the global automation of the world. When I say automation, it's not only in IT.

Before, to book a taxi, you had to call a callcenter, you had to discuss with a person, which was filling your information, sometimes wrongly, then dispatch it to a taxi driver. This job, even if it's an hard job, is intellectualy equivalent to a toaster. What Uber, Lyft, Careem, etc are doing around the world is doing some automation on this system. You can now book a taxi with Bots, and soon, they will even automate the drivers.

When I see French Politicians, trying to keep jobs, instead of increasing the intellectual level of the population, I become crazy. If one someone can automate my job, I will be happy, because I will be able to learn mroe stuff, and increase my knowledge ine different fields. But this vision is creating a massive economic shift.

Since long time, people are trading their work force for a place in the society. If you reduce this required workforce, what will you trade? Thatś why a lot of debates about the basic income are discussed right now, it's the creation of a new society paradigm.

Economic sector, when you was at school, it's a big bullshit (cf colin clark). During the 18th century, a majority of the workforce was dedicated to the agriculture. Now, only 3.6 % of the population in France is active, and even if the number of farm has reduced, their productivity has increased, as a result of automation. It was the same scenario for the industrial revolution.
